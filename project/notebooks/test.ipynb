      "{'title': 'Biomaterial', 'content': 'A biomaterial is a substance that has been engineered to interact with biological systems for a medical purpose – either a therapeutic (treat, augment, repair, or replace a tissue function of the body) or a diagnostic one. The corresponding field of study, called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering, is about fifty years old. It has experienced steady growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.\\nA biomaterial is different from a biological material, such as bone, that is produced by a biological system. However, \"biomaterial\" and \"biological material\" are often used interchangeably. Further, the word \"bioterial\" has been proposed as a potential alternate word for biologically-produced materials such as bone, or fungal biocomposites. Additionally, care should be exercised in defining a biomaterial as biocompatible, since it is application-specific. A biomaterial that is biocompatible or suitable for one application may not be biocompatible in another.\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\nBiomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in the laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprise the whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, like being used for a heart valve, or maybe bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also commonly used in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.\\n\\n\\nBioactivity\\nThe ability of an engineered biomaterial to induce a physiological response that is supportive of the biomaterial\\'s function and performance is known as bioactivity. Most commonly, in bioactive glasses and bioactive ceramics this term refers to the ability of implanted materials to bond well with surrounding tissue in either osteo conductive or osseo productive roles. Bone implant materials are often designed to promote bone growth while dissolving into surrounding body fluid. Thus for many biomaterials good biocompatibility along with good strength and dissolution rates are desirable. Commonly, bioactivity of biomaterials is gauged by the surface biomineralization in which a native layer of hydroxyapatite is formed at the surface. These days, the development of clinically useful biomaterials is greatly enhanced by the advent of computational routines that can predict the molecular effects of biomaterials in a therapeutic setting based on limited in vitro experimentation.\\n\\n\\nSelf-assembly\\nSelf-assembly is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, micelles, etc.) without the influence of any external forces. Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into thermodynamically stable, structurally well-defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the seven crystal systems found in metallurgy and mineralogy (e.g., face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, etc.). The fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell (lattice parameter) in each particular case.\\nMolecular self assembly is found widely in biological systems and provides the basis of a wide variety of complex biological structures. This includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructural features and designs found in nature. Thus, self-assembly is also emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and nanotechnology. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, emulsions, phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures, which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization.\\n\\n\\nStructural hierarchy\\nNearly all materials could be seen as hierarchically structured, since the changes in spatial scale bring about different mechanisms of deformation and damage. However, in biological materials, this hierarchical organization is inherent to the microstructure. One of the first examples of this, in the history of structural biology, is the early X-ray scattering work on the hierarchical structure of hair and wool by Astbury and Woods. In bone, for example, collagen is the building block of the organic matrix, a triple helix with diameter of 1.5 nm. These tropocollagen molecules are intercalated with the mineral phase (hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate) forming fibrils that curl into helicoids of alternating directions. These \"osteons\" are the basic building blocks of bones, with the volume fraction distribution between organic and mineral phase being about 60/40.\\nIn another level of complexity, the hydroxyapatite crystals are mineral platelets that have a diameter of approximately 70 to 100 nm and thickness of 1 nm. They originally nucleate at the gaps between collagen fibrils.\\nSimilarly, the hierarchy of abalone shell begins at the nanolevel, with an organic layer having a thickness of 20 to 30 nm. This layer proceeds with single crystals of aragonite (a polymorph of CaCO3) consisting of \"bricks\" with dimensions of 0.5 and finishing with layers approximately 0.3 mm (mesostructure).\\nCrabs are arthropods, whose carapace is made of a mineralized hard component (exhibits brittle fracture) and a softer organic component composed primarily of chitin. The brittle component is arranged in a helical pattern. Each of these mineral \"rods\" (1 μm diameter) contains chitin–protein fibrils with approximately 60 nm diameter. These fibrils are made of 3 nm diameter canals that link the interior and exterior of the shell.\\n\\n\\nApplications\\nBiomaterials are used in:\\n\\nJoint replacements\\nBone plates \\nIntraocular lenses (IOLs) for eye surgery\\nBone cement\\nArtificial ligaments and tendons\\nDental implants for tooth fixation\\nBlood vessel prostheses\\nHeart valves\\nSkin repair devices (artificial tissue)\\nCochlear replacements\\nContact lenses\\nBreast implants\\nDrug delivery mechanisms\\nSustainable materials\\nVascular grafts\\nStents\\nNerve conduits\\nSurgical sutures, clips, and staples for wound closure\\nPins and screws for fracture stabilisation\\nSurgical mesh\\nBiomaterials must be compatible with the body, and there are often issues of biocompatibility, which must be resolved before a product can be placed on the market and used in a clinical setting. Because of this, biomaterials are usually subjected to the same requirements as those undergone by new drug therapies. All manufacturing companies are also required to ensure traceability of all of their products, so that if a defective product is discovered, others in the same batch may be traced.\\n\\n\\nBone grafts\\nCalcium sulfate (its α- and β-hemihydrates) is a well known biocompatible material that is widely used as a bone graft substitute in dentistry or as its binder.\\n\\n\\nHeart valves\\nIn the United States, 49% of the 250,000 valve replacement procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant. The most widely used valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth, with both allowing the flow of blood as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow. The valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont\\'s trade name for polyethylene terephthalate). The mesh allows for the body\\'s tissue to grow, while incorporating the valve.\\n\\n\\nSkin repair\\n\\nMost of the time, artificial tissue is grown from the patient\\'s own cells. However, when the damage is so extreme that it is impossible to use the patient\\'s own cells, artificial tissue cells are grown. The difficulty is in finding a scaffold that the cells can grow and organize on. The characteristics of the scaffold must be that it is biocompatible, cells can adhere to the scaffold, mechanically strong and biodegradable. One successful scaffold is a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid.\\n\\n\\nProperties\\nAs discussed previously, biomaterials are used in medical devices to treat, assist, or replace a function within the human body. The application of a specific biomaterial must combine the necessary composition, material properties, structure, and desired in vivo reaction in order to perform the desired function. Categorizations of different desired properties are defined in order to maximize functional results.\\n\\n\\nHost response\\nHost response is defined as the \"response of the host organism (local and systemic) to the implanted material or device\". Most materials will have a reaction when in contact with the human body. The success of a biomaterial relies on the host tissue\\'s reaction with the foreign material. Specific reactions between the host tissue and the biomaterial can be generated through the biocompatibility of the material.\\n\\n\\nBiomaterial and tissue interactions\\nThe in vivo functionality and longevity of any implantable medical device is affected by the body\\'s response to the foreign material. The body undergoes a cascade of processes defined under the foreign body response (FBR) in order to protect the host from the foreign material. The interactions between the device upon the host tissue/blood as well as the host tissue/blood upon the device must be understood in order to prevent complications and device failure.\\nTissue injury caused by device implantation causes inflammatory and healing responses during FBR. The inflammatory response occurs within two time periods: the acute phase, and the chronic phase. The acute phase occurs during the initial hours to days of implantation, and is identified by fluid and protein exudation along with a neutrophilic reaction. During the acute phase, the body attempts to clean and heal the wound by delivering excess blood, proteins, and monocytes are called to the site. Continued inflammation leads to the chronic phase, which can be categorized by the presence of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. In addition, blood vessels and connective tissue form in order to heal the wounded area.\\n\\n\\nCompatibility\\nBiocompatibility is related to the behavior of biomaterials in various environments under various chemical and physical conditions. The term may refer to specific properties of a material without specifying where or how the material is to be used. For example, a material may elicit little or no immune response in a given organism, and may or may not able to integrate with a particular cell type or tissue. Immuno-informed biomaterials that direct the immune response rather than attempting to circumvent the process is one approach that shows promise. The ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into \"how biomaterials interact with the human body\" and eventually \"how those interactions determine the clinical success of a medical device (such as pacemaker or hip replacement)\". Modern medical devices and prostheses are often made of more than one material, so it might not always be sufficient to talk about the biocompatibility of a specific material. Surgical implantation of a biomaterial into the body triggers an organism-inflammatory reaction with the associated healing of the damaged tissue. Depending upon the composition of the implanted material, the surface of the implant, the mechanism of fatigue, and chemical decomposition there are several other reactions possible. These can be local as well as systemic. These include immune response, foreign body reaction with the isolation of the implant with a vascular connective tissue, possible infection, and impact on the lifespan of the implant. Graft-versus-host disease is an auto- and alloimmune disorder, exhibiting a variable clinical course. It can manifest in either acute or chronic form, affecting multiple organs and tissues and causing serious complications in clinical practice, both during transplantation and implementation of biocompatible materials.\\n\\n\\nToxicity\\nA biomaterial should perform its intended function within the living body without negatively affecting other bodily tissues and organs. In order to prevent unwanted organ and tissue interactions, biomaterials should be non-toxic. The toxicity of a biomaterial refers to the substances that are emitted from the biomaterial while in vivo. A biomaterial should not give off anything to its environment unless it is intended to do so. Nontoxicity means that biomaterial is: noncarcinogenic, nonpyrogenic, nonallergenic, blood compatible, and noninflammatory. However, a biomaterial can be designed to include toxicity for an intended purpose. For example, application of toxic biomaterial is studied during in vivo and in vitro cancer immunotherapy testing. Toxic biomaterials offer an opportunity to manipulate and control cancer cells. One recent study states: \"Advanced nanobiomaterials, including liposomes, polymers, and silica, play a vital role in the codelivery of drugs and immunomodulators. These nanobiomaterial-based delivery systems could effectively promote antitumor immune responses and simultaneously reduce toxic adverse effects.\" This is a prime example of how the biocompatibility of a biomaterial can be altered to produce any desired function.\\n\\n\\nBiodegradable biomaterials\\nBiodegradable biomaterials refers to materials that are degradable through natural enzymatic reactions. The application of biodegradable synthetic polymers began in the later 1960s. Biodegradable materials have an advantage over other materials, as they have lower risk of harmful effects long term. In addition to ethical advancements using biodegradable materials, they also improve biocompatibility for materials used for implantation. Several properties including biocompatibility are important when considering different biodegradable biomaterials. Biodegradable biomaterials can be synthetic or natural depending on their source and type of extracellular matrix (ECM).\\n\\n\\nBiocompatible plastics\\nSome of the most commonly-used biocompatible materials (or biomaterials) are polymers due to their inherent flexibility and tunable mechanical properties. Medical devices made of plastics are often made of a select few including: cyclic olefin polymer (COP), cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), polycarbonate (PC), polyetherimide (PEI), medical grade polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethersulfone (PES), polyethylene (PE), polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and even polypropylene (PP). To ensure biocompatibility, there are a series of regulated tests that material must pass to be certified for use. These include the United States Pharmacopoeia IV (USP Class IV) Biological Reactivity Test and the International Standards Organization 10993 (ISO 10993) Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices. The main objective of biocompatibility tests is to quantify the acute and chronic toxicity of material and determine any potential adverse effects during use conditions, thus the tests required for a given material are dependent on its end-use (i.e. blood, central nervous system, etc.).\\n\\n\\nSurface and bulk properties\\nTwo properties that have a large effect on the functionality of a biomaterial is the surface and bulk properties.\\nBulk properties refers to the physical and chemical properties that compose the biomaterial for its entire lifetime. They can be specifically generated to mimic the physiochemical properties of the tissue that the material is replacing. They are mechanical properties that are generated from a material\\'s atomic and molecular construction.\\nImportant bulk properties:\\n\\nChemical Composition\\nMicrostructure\\nElasticity\\nTensile Strength\\nDensity\\nHardness\\nElectrical Conductivity\\nThermal Conductivity\\nSurface properties refers to the chemical and topographical features on the surface of the biomaterial that will have direct interaction with the host blood/tissue. Surface engineering and modification allows clinicians to better control the interactions of a biomaterial with the host living system.\\nImportant surface properties:\\n\\nWettability (surface energy)\\nSurface chemistry\\nSurface textures (smooth/rough)\\nTopographical factors including: size, shape, alignment, structure determine the roughness of a material.\\nSurface Tension\\nSurface Charge\\n\\n\\nMechanical properties\\nIn addition to a material being certified as biocompatible, biomaterials must be engineered specifically to their target application within a medical device. This is especially important in terms of mechanical properties which govern the way that a given biomaterial behaves. One of the most relevant material parameters is the Young\\'s Modulus, E, which describes a material\\'s elastic response to stresses. The Young\\'s Moduli of the tissue and the device that is being coupled to it must closely match for optimal compatibility between device and body, whether the device is implanted or mounted externally. Matching the elastic modulus makes it possible to limit movement and delamination at the biointerface between implant and tissue as well as avoiding stress concentration that can lead to mechanical failure. Other important properties are the tensile and compressive strengths which quantify the maximum stresses a material can withstand before breaking and may be used to set stress limits that a device may be subject to within or external to the body. Depending on the application, it may be desirable for a biomaterial to have high strength so that it is resistant to failure when subjected to a load, however in other applications it may be beneficial for the material to be low strength. There is a careful balance between strength and stiffness that determines how robust to failure the biomaterial device is. Typically, as the elasticity of the biomaterial increases, the ultimate tensile strength will decrease and vice versa. One application where a high-strength material is undesired is in neural probes; if a high-strength material is used in these applications the tissue will always fail before the device does (under applied load) because the Young\\'s Modulus of the dura mater and cerebral tissue is on the order of 500 Pa. When this happens, irreversible damage to the brain can occur, thus the biomaterial must have an elastic modulus less than or equal to brain tissue and a low tensile strength if an applied load is expected.\\nFor implanted biomaterials that may experience temperature fluctuations, e.g., dental implants, ductility is important. The material must be ductile for a similar reason that the tensile strength cannot be too high, ductility allows the material to bend without fracture and also prevents the concentration of stresses in the tissue when the temperature changes. The material property of toughness is also important for dental implants as well as any other rigid, load-bearing implant such as a replacement hip joint. Toughness describes the material\\'s ability to deform under applied stress without fracturing and having a high toughness allows biomaterial implants to last longer within the body, especially when subjected to large stress or cyclically loaded stresses, like the stresses applied to a hip joint during running.\\nFor medical devices that are implanted or attached to the skin, another important property requiring consideration is the flexural rigidity, D. Flexural rigidity will determine how well the device surface can maintain conformal contact with the tissue surface, which is especially important for devices that are measuring tissue motion (strain), electrical signals (impedance), or are designed to stick to the skin without delaminating, as in epidermal electronics. Since flexural rigidity depends on the thickness of the material, h, to the third power (h3), it is very important that a biomaterial can be formed into thin layers in the previously mentioned applications where conformality is paramount.\\n\\n\\nStructure\\nThe molecular composition of a biomaterial determines the physical and chemical properties of a biomaterial. These compositions create complex structures that allow the biomaterial to function, and therefore are necessary to define and understand in order to develop a biomaterial. biomaterials can be designed to replicate natural organisms, a process known as biomimetics. The structure of a biomaterial can be observed at different at different levels to better understand a materials properties and function.\\n\\n\\nAtomic structure\\n\\nThe arrangement of atoms and ions within a material is one of the most important structural properties of a biomaterial. The atomic structure of a material can be viewed at different levels, the sub atomic level, atomic or molecular level, as well as the ultra-structure created by the atoms and molecules. Intermolecular forces between the atoms and molecules that compose the material will determine its material and chemical properties.\\nThe sub atomic level observes the electrical structure of an individual atom to define its interactions with other atoms and molecules. The molecular structure observes the arrangement of atoms within the material. Finally the ultra-structure observes the 3-D structure created from the atomic and molecular structures of the material. The solid-state of a material is characterized by the intramolecular bonds between the atoms and molecules that comprise the material. Types of intramolecular bonds include: ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds. These bonds will dictate the physical and chemical properties of the material, as well as determine the type of material (ceramic, metal, or polymer).\\n\\n\\nMicrostructure\\n\\nThe microstructure of a material refers to the structure of an object, organism, or material as viewed at magnifications exceeding 25 times. It is composed of the different phases of form, size, and distribution of grains, pores, precipitates, etc. The majority of solid microstructures are crystalline, however some materials such as certain polymers will not crystallize when in the solid state.\\n\\n\\nCrystalline structure\\nCrystalline structure is the composition of ions, atoms, and molecules that are held together and ordered in a 3D shape. The main difference between a crystalline structure and an amorphous structure is the order of the components. Crystalline has the highest level of order possible in the material where amorphous structure consists of irregularities in the ordering pattern. One way to describe crystalline structures is through the crystal lattice, which is a three-dimensional representation of the location of a repeating factor (unit cell) in the structure denoted with lattices. There are 14 different configurations of atom arrangement in a crystalline structure, and are all represented under Bravais lattices.\\n\\n\\nDefects of crystalline structure\\n\\nDuring the formation of a crystalline structure, different impurities, irregularities, and other defects can form. These imperfections can form through deformation of the solid, rapid cooling, or high energy radiation. Types of defects include point defects, line defects, as well as edge dislocation.\\n\\n\\nMacrostructure\\nMacrostructure refers to the overall geometric properties that will influence the force at failure, stiffness, bending, stress distribution, and the weight of the material. It requires little to no magnification to reveal the macrostructure of a material. Observing the macrostructure reveals properties such as cavities, porosity, gas bubbles, stratification, and fissures. The material\\'s strength and elastic modulus are both independent of the macrostructure.\\n\\n\\nNatural biomaterials\\nBiomaterials can be constructed using only materials sourced from plants and animals in order to alter, replace, or repair human tissue/organs. Use of natural biomaterials were used as early as ancient Egypt, where indigenous people used animal skin as sutures. A more modern example is a hip replacement using ivory material which was first recorded in Germany 1891.\\nValuable criteria for viable natural biomaterials:\\n\\nBiodegradable\\nBiocompatible\\nAble to promote cell attachment and growth\\nNon-toxic\\nExamples of natural biomaterials:\\n\\nAlginate\\nMatrigel\\nFibrin\\nCollagen\\nMyocardial tissue engineering\\n\\n\\nBiopolymers\\n\\nBiopolymers are polymers produced by living organisms. Cellulose and starch, proteins and peptides, and DNA and RNA are all examples of biopolymers, in which the monomeric units, respectively, are sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides. Cellulose is both the most common biopolymer and the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33% of all plant matter is cellulose. On a similar manner, silk (proteinaceous biopolymer) has garnered tremendous research interest in a myriad of domains including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, microfluidics, drug delivery.\\n\\n\\nSee also\\nBionics\\nHydrogel\\nPolymeric surface\\nSurface modification of biomaterials with proteins\\nSynthetic biodegradable polymer\\nList of biomaterials\\n\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nJournal of Biomaterials Applications\\nCREB – Biomedical Engineering Research Centre Archived 2021-05-07 at the Wayback Machine\\nDepartment of Biomaterials at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam-Golm, Germany\\nOpen Innovation Campus for Biomaterials', 'categories': ['Category:All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements', 'Category:Articles with short description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from March 2023', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from May 2024', 'Category:Biomaterials', 'Category:Biomolecules', 'Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher', 'Category:CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list']}\n",

It was first published by Ernst Zermelo as part of his set theory in 1908.\\n\\n\\nFormal statement\\nUsing first-order logic primitive symbols, the axiom can be expressed as follows:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∃\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n         \\n        (\\n        ∃\\n        o\\n         \\n        (\\n        o\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n         \\n        ∧\\n        ¬\\n        ∃\\n        n\\n         \\n        (\\n        n\\n        ∈\\n        o\\n        )\\n        )\\n         \\n        ∧\\n         \\n        ∀\\n        x\\n         \\n        (\\n        x\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n        ⇒\\n        ∃\\n        y\\n         \\n        (\\n        y\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n         \\n        ∧\\n         \\n        ∀\\n        a\\n         \\n        (\\n        a\\n        ∈\\n        y\\n        ⇔\\n        (\\n        a\\n        ∈\\n        x\\n         \\n        ∨\\n         \\n        a\\n        =\\n        x\\n        )\\n        )\\n        )\\n        )\\n        )\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\exists \\\\mathrm {I} \\\\ (\\\\exists o\\\\ (o\\\\in \\\\mathrm {I} \\\\ \\\\land \\\\lnot \\\\exists n\\\\ (n\\\\in o))\\\\ \\\\land \\\\ \\\\forall x\\\\ (x\\\\in \\\\mathrm {I} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\exists y\\\\ (y\\\\in \\\\mathrm {I} \\\\ \\\\land \\\\ \\\\forall a\\\\ (a\\\\in y\\\\Leftrightarrow (a\\\\in x\\\\ \\\\lor \\\\ a=x))))).}\\n  \\n\\nIn English, this sentence means: \"there exists a set \\n𝐈 such that the empty set is an element of it, and for every element \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n of 𝐈, there exists an element \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n of 𝐈 such that \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n is an element of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n, the elements of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n are also elements of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n, and nothing else is an element of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n.\"\\nThis sentence can be abbreviated in set-builder notation as:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∃\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n        \\n        (\\n        ∅\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n        \\n        ∧\\n        \\n        ∀\\n        x\\n        \\n        (\\n        x\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n        ⇒\\n        \\n        (\\n        x\\n        ∪\\n        {\\n        x\\n        }\\n        )\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          I\\n        \\n        )\\n        )\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\exists \\\\mathrm {I} \\\\,(\\\\varnothing \\\\in \\\\mathrm {I} \\\\,\\\\land \\\\,\\\\forall x\\\\,(x\\\\in \\\\mathrm {I} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\,(x\\\\cup \\\\{x\\\\})\\\\in \\\\mathrm {I} )).}\\n  \\n\\nSome mathematicians may call a set built this way an inductive set.\\n\\n\\nInterpretation and consequences\\nThis axiom is closely related to the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers in set theory, in which the successor of x is defined as x ∪ {x}. If x is a set, then it follows from the other axioms of set theory that this successor is also a uniquely defined set. Successors are used to define the usual set-theoretic encoding of the natural numbers.  In this encoding, zero is the empty set:\\n\\n0 = {}.\\nThe number 1 is the successor of 0:\\n\\n1 = 0 ∪ {0} = {} ∪ {0} = {0} = {{}}.\\nLikewise, 2 is the successor of 1:\\n\\n2 = 1 ∪ {1} = {0} ∪ {1} = {0, 1} = { {}, {{}} },\\nand so on:\\n\\n3 = {0, 1, 2} = { {}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}} };\\n4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} = { {}, {{}}, { {}, {{}} }, { {}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}} } }.\\nA consequence of this definition is that every natural number is equal to the set of all preceding natural numbers. The count of elements in each set, at the top level, is the same as the represented natural number, and the nesting depth of the most deeply nested empty set {}, including its nesting in the set that represents the number of which it is a part, is also equal to the natural number that the set represents.\\nThis construction forms the natural numbers. However, the other axioms are insufficient to prove the existence of the set of all natural numbers, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            N\\n          \\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {N} _{0}}\\n  \\n. Therefore, its existence is taken as an axiom – the axiom of infinity. This axiom asserts that there is a set I that contains 0 and is closed under the operation of taking the successor; that is, for each element of I, the successor of that element is also in I.\\nThus the essence of the axiom is:\\n\\nThere is a set, I, that includes all the natural numbers.\\nThe axiom of infinity is also one of the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms.\\n\\n\\nExtracting the natural numbers from the infinite set\\nThe infinite set I is a superset of the natural numbers. To show that the natural numbers themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of specification can be applied to remove unwanted elements, leaving the set N of all natural numbers. This set is unique by the axiom of extensionality.\\nTo extract the natural numbers, we need a definition of which sets are natural numbers. The natural numbers can be defined in a way that does not assume any axioms except the axiom of extensionality and the axiom of induction—a natural number is either zero or a successor and each of its elements is either zero or a successor of another of its elements. In formal language, the definition says:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∀\\n        n\\n        (\\n        n\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          N\\n        \\n        \\n        ⟺\\n        \\n        (\\n        [\\n        n\\n        =\\n        ∅\\n        \\n        \\n        ∨\\n        \\n        \\n        ∃\\n        k\\n        (\\n        n\\n        =\\n        k\\n        ∪\\n        {\\n        k\\n        }\\n        )\\n        ]\\n        \\n        \\n        ∧\\n        \\n        \\n        ∀\\n        m\\n        ∈\\n        n\\n        [\\n        m\\n        =\\n        ∅\\n        \\n        \\n        ∨\\n        \\n        \\n        ∃\\n        k\\n        ∈\\n        n\\n        (\\n        m\\n        =\\n        k\\n        ∪\\n        {\\n        k\\n        }\\n        )\\n        ]\\n        )\\n        )\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\forall n(n\\\\in \\\\mathbf {N} \\\\iff ([n=\\\\emptyset \\\\,\\\\,\\\\lor \\\\,\\\\,\\\\exists k(n=k\\\\cup \\\\{k\\\\})]\\\\,\\\\,\\\\land \\\\,\\\\,\\\\forall m\\\\in n[m=\\\\emptyset \\\\,\\\\,\\\\lor \\\\,\\\\,\\\\exists k\\\\in n(m=k\\\\cup \\\\{k\\\\})])).}\\n  \\n\\nOr, even more formally:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∀\\n        n\\n        (\\n        n\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          N\\n        \\n        \\n        ⟺\\n        \\n        (\\n        [\\n        ∀\\n        k\\n        (\\n        ¬\\n        k\\n        ∈\\n        n\\n        )\\n        ∨\\n        ∃\\n        k\\n        ∀\\n        j\\n        (\\n        j\\n        ∈\\n        n\\n        \\n        ⟺\\n        \\n        (\\n        j\\n        ∈\\n        k\\n        ∨\\n        j\\n        =\\n        k\\n        )\\n        )\\n        ]\\n        \\n        ∧\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\forall n(n\\\\in \\\\mathbf {N} \\\\iff ([\\\\forall k(\\\\lnot k\\\\in n)\\\\lor \\\\exists k\\\\forall j(j\\\\in n\\\\iff (j\\\\in k\\\\lor j=k))]\\\\;\\\\land }\\n  \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∀\\n        m\\n        (\\n        m\\n        ∈\\n        n\\n        ⇒\\n        [\\n        ∀\\n        k\\n        (\\n        ¬\\n        k\\n        ∈\\n        m\\n        )\\n        ∨\\n        ∃\\n        k\\n        (\\n        k\\n        ∈\\n        n\\n        ∧\\n        ∀\\n        j\\n        (\\n        j\\n        ∈\\n        m\\n        \\n        ⟺\\n        \\n        (\\n        j\\n        ∈\\n        k\\n        ∨\\n        j\\n        =\\n        k\\n        )\\n        )\\n        )\\n        ]\\n        )\\n        )\\n        )\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\forall m(m\\\\in n\\\\Rightarrow [\\\\forall k(\\\\lnot k\\\\in m)\\\\lor \\\\exists k(k\\\\in n\\\\land \\\\forall j(j\\\\in m\\\\iff (j\\\\in k\\\\lor j=k)))]))).}\\n  \\n\\n\\nAlternative method\\nAn alternative method is the following.

This implies that x is an infinite set without saying much about its structure. However, with the help of the other axioms of ZF, we can show that this implies the existence of ω. First, if we take the powerset of any infinite set x, then that powerset will contain elements that are subsets of x of every finite cardinality (among other subsets of x). Proving the existence of those finite subsets may require either the axiom of separation or the axioms of pairing and union. Then we can apply the axiom of replacement to replace each element of that powerset of x by the initial ordinal number of the same cardinality (or zero, if there is no such ordinal). The result will be an infinite set of ordinals. Then we can apply the axiom of union to that to get an ordinal greater than or equal to ω.\\n\\n\\nIndependence\\nThe axiom of infinity cannot be proved from the other axioms of ZFC if they are consistent. (To see why, note that ZFC \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ⊢\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\vdash }\\n  \\n Con(ZFC − Infinity) and use Gödel\\'s Second incompleteness theorem.)\\nThe negation of the axiom of infinity cannot be derived from the rest of the axioms of ZFC, if they are consistent. (This is tantamount to saying that ZFC is consistent, if the other axioms are consistent.) Thus, ZFC implies neither the axiom of infinity nor its negation and is compatible with either.\\nIndeed, using the von Neumann universe, we can build a model of ZFC − Infinity + (¬Infinity). It is \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          V\\n          \\n            ω\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle V_{\\\\omega }\\\\!}\\n  \\n, the class of hereditarily finite sets, with the inherited membership relation. Note that if the axiom of the empty set is not taken as a part of this system (since it can be derived from ZF + Infinity), then the empty domain also satisfies ZFC − Infinity + ¬Infinity, as all of its axioms are universally quantified, and thus trivially satisfied if no set exists.\\nThe cardinality of the set of natural numbers, aleph null (\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          ℵ\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\aleph _{0}}\\n  \\n), has many of the properties of a large cardinal. Thus the axiom of infinity is sometimes regarded as the first large cardinal axiom, and conversely large cardinal axioms are sometimes called stronger axioms of infinity.\\n\\n\\nSee also\\nPeano axioms\\nFinitism\\n\\n\\nReferences', 'categories': ['Category:All articles needing additional references', 'Category:Articles needing additional references from October 2019', 'Category:Articles with short description', 'Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from March 2023', 'Category:Axioms of set theory', 'Category:Infinity', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata']}\n",

      "{'title': 'Biomaterial', 'content': 'A biomaterial is a substance that has been engineered to interact with biological systems for a medical purpose – either a therapeutic (treat, augment, repair, or replace a tissue function of the body) or a diagnostic one. The corresponding field of study, called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering, is about fifty years old. It has experienced steady growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.\\nA biomaterial is different from a biological material, such as bone, that is produced by a biological system. However, \"biomaterial\" and \"biological material\" are often used interchangeably. Further, the word \"bioterial\" has been proposed as a potential alternate word for biologically-produced materials such as bone, or fungal biocomposites. Additionally, care should be exercised in defining a biomaterial as biocompatible, since it is application-specific. A biomaterial that is biocompatible or suitable for one application may not be biocompatible in another.\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\nBiomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in the laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprise the whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, like being used for a heart valve, or maybe bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also commonly used in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.\\n\\n\\nBioactivity\\nThe ability of an engineered biomaterial to induce a physiological response that is supportive of the biomaterial\\'s function and performance is known as bioactivity. Most commonly, in bioactive glasses and bioactive ceramics this term refers to the ability of implanted materials to bond well with surrounding tissue in either osteo conductive or osseo productive roles. Bone implant materials are often designed to promote bone growth while dissolving into surrounding body fluid. Thus for many biomaterials good biocompatibility along with good strength and dissolution rates are desirable. Commonly, bioactivity of biomaterials is gauged by the surface biomineralization in which a native layer of hydroxyapatite is formed at the surface. These days, the development of clinically useful biomaterials is greatly enhanced by the advent of computational routines that can predict the molecular effects of biomaterials in a therapeutic setting based on limited in vitro experimentation.\\n\\n\\nSelf-assembly\\nSelf-assembly is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, micelles, etc.) without the influence of any external forces. Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into thermodynamically stable, structurally well-defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the seven crystal systems found in metallurgy and mineralogy (e.g., face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, etc.). The fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell (lattice parameter) in each particular case.\\nMolecular self assembly is found widely in biological systems and provides the basis of a wide variety of complex biological structures. This includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructural features and designs found in nature. Thus, self-assembly is also emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and nanotechnology. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, emulsions, phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures, which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization.\\n\\n\\nStructural hierarchy\\nNearly all materials could be seen as hierarchically structured, since the changes in spatial scale bring about different mechanisms of deformation and damage. However, in biological materials, this hierarchical organization is inherent to the microstructure. One of the first examples of this, in the history of structural biology, is the early X-ray scattering work on the hierarchical structure of hair and wool by Astbury and Woods. In bone, for example, collagen is the building block of the organic matrix, a triple helix with diameter of 1.5 nm. These tropocollagen molecules are intercalated with the mineral phase (hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate) forming fibrils that curl into helicoids of alternating directions. These \"osteons\" are the basic building blocks of bones, with the volume fraction distribution between organic and mineral phase being about 60/40.\\nIn another level of complexity, the hydroxyapatite crystals are mineral platelets that have a diameter of approximately 70 to 100 nm and thickness of 1 nm. They originally nucleate at the gaps between collagen fibrils.\\nSimilarly, the hierarchy of abalone shell begins at the nanolevel, with an organic layer having a thickness of 20 to 30 nm. This layer proceeds with single crystals of aragonite (a polymorph of CaCO3) consisting of \"bricks\" with dimensions of 0.5 and finishing with layers approximately 0.3 mm (mesostructure).\\nCrabs are arthropods, whose carapace is made of a mineralized hard component (exhibits brittle fracture) and a softer organic component composed primarily of chitin. The brittle component is arranged in a helical pattern. Each of these mineral \"rods\" (1 μm diameter) contains chitin–protein fibrils with approximately 60 nm diameter. These fibrils are made of 3 nm diameter canals that link the interior and exterior of the shell.\\n\\n\\nApplications\\nBiomaterials are used in:\\n\\nJoint replacements\\nBone plates \\nIntraocular lenses (IOLs) for eye surgery\\nBone cement\\nArtificial ligaments and tendons\\nDental implants for tooth fixation\\nBlood vessel prostheses\\nHeart valves\\nSkin repair devices (artificial tissue)\\nCochlear replacements\\nContact lenses\\nBreast implants\\nDrug delivery mechanisms\\nSustainable materials\\nVascular grafts\\nStents\\nNerve conduits\\nSurgical sutures, clips, and staples for wound closure\\nPins and screws for fracture stabilisation\\nSurgical mesh\\nBiomaterials must be compatible with the body, and there are often issues of biocompatibility, which must be resolved before a product can be placed on the market and used in a clinical setting. Because of this, biomaterials are usually subjected to the same requirements as those undergone by new drug therapies. All manufacturing companies are also required to ensure traceability of all of their products, so that if a defective product is discovered, others in the same batch may be traced.\\n\\n\\nBone grafts\\nCalcium sulfate (its α- and β-hemihydrates) is a well known biocompatible material that is widely used as a bone graft substitute in dentistry or as its binder.\\n\\n\\nHeart valves\\nIn the United States, 49% of the 250,000 valve replacement procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant. The most widely used valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth, with both allowing the flow of blood as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow. The valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont\\'s trade name for polyethylene terephthalate). The mesh allows for the body\\'s tissue to grow, while incorporating the valve.\\n\\n\\nSkin repair\\n\\nMost of the time, artificial tissue is grown from the patient\\'s own cells. However, when the damage is so extreme that it is impossible to use the patient\\'s own cells, artificial tissue cells are grown. The difficulty is in finding a scaffold that the cells can grow and organize on. The characteristics of the scaffold must be that it is biocompatible, cells can adhere to the scaffold, mechanically strong and biodegradable. One successful scaffold is a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid.\\n\\n\\nProperties\\nAs discussed previously, biomaterials are used in medical devices to treat, assist, or replace a function within the human body. The application of a specific biomaterial must combine the necessary composition, material properties, structure, and desired in vivo reaction in order to perform the desired function. Categorizations of different desired properties are defined in order to maximize functional results.\\n\\n\\nHost response\\nHost response is defined as the \"response of the host organism (local and systemic) to the implanted material or device\". Most materials will have a reaction when in contact with the human body. The success of a biomaterial relies on the host tissue\\'s reaction with the foreign material. Specific reactions between the host tissue and the biomaterial can be generated through the biocompatibility of the material.\\n\\n\\nBiomaterial and tissue interactions\\nThe in vivo functionality and longevity of any implantable medical device is affected by the body\\'s response to the foreign material. The body undergoes a cascade of processes defined under the foreign body response (FBR) in order to protect the host from the foreign material. The interactions between the device upon the host tissue/blood as well as the host tissue/blood upon the device must be understood in order to prevent complications and device failure.\\nTissue injury caused by device implantation causes inflammatory and healing responses during FBR. The inflammatory response occurs within two time periods: the acute phase, and the chronic phase. The acute phase occurs during the initial hours to days of implantation, and is identified by fluid and protein exudation along with a neutrophilic reaction. During the acute phase, the body attempts to clean and heal the wound by delivering excess blood, proteins, and monocytes are called to the site. Continued inflammation leads to the chronic phase, which can be categorized by the presence of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. In addition, blood vessels and connective tissue form in order to heal the wounded area.\\n\\n\\nCompatibility\\nBiocompatibility is related to the behavior of biomaterials in various environments under various chemical and physical conditions. The term may refer to specific properties of a material without specifying where or how the material is to be used. For example, a material may elicit little or no immune response in a given organism, and may or may not able to integrate with a particular cell type or tissue. Immuno-informed biomaterials that direct the immune response rather than attempting to circumvent the process is one approach that shows promise. The ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into \"how biomaterials interact with the human body\" and eventually \"how those interactions determine the clinical success of a medical device (such as pacemaker or hip replacement)\". Modern medical devices and prostheses are often made of more than one material, so it might not always be sufficient to talk about the biocompatibility of a specific material. Surgical implantation of a biomaterial into the body triggers an organism-inflammatory reaction with the associated healing of the damaged tissue. Depending upon the composition of the implanted material, the surface of the implant, the mechanism of fatigue, and chemical decomposition there are several other reactions possible. These can be local as well as systemic. These include immune response, foreign body reaction with the isolation of the implant with a vascular connective tissue, possible infection, and impact on the lifespan of the implant. Graft-versus-host disease is an auto- and alloimmune disorder, exhibiting a variable clinical course. It can manifest in either acute or chronic form, affecting multiple organs and tissues and causing serious complications in clinical practice, both during transplantation and implementation of biocompatible materials.\\n\\n\\nToxicity\\nA biomaterial should perform its intended function within the living body without negatively affecting other bodily tissues and organs. In order to prevent unwanted organ and tissue interactions, biomaterials should be non-toxic. The toxicity of a biomaterial refers to the substances that are emitted from the biomaterial while in vivo. A biomaterial should not give off anything to its environment unless it is intended to do so. Nontoxicity means that biomaterial is: noncarcinogenic, nonpyrogenic, nonallergenic, blood compatible, and noninflammatory. However, a biomaterial can be designed to include toxicity for an intended purpose. For example, application of toxic biomaterial is studied during in vivo and in vitro cancer immunotherapy testing. Toxic biomaterials offer an opportunity to manipulate and control cancer cells. One recent study states: \"Advanced nanobiomaterials, including liposomes, polymers, and silica, play a vital role in the codelivery of drugs and immunomodulators. These nanobiomaterial-based delivery systems could effectively promote antitumor immune responses and simultaneously reduce toxic adverse effects.\" This is a prime example of how the biocompatibility of a biomaterial can be altered to produce any desired function.\\n\\n\\nBiodegradable biomaterials\\nBiodegradable biomaterials refers to materials that are degradable through natural enzymatic reactions. The application of biodegradable synthetic polymers began in the later 1960s. Biodegradable materials have an advantage over other materials, as they have lower risk of harmful effects long term. In addition to ethical advancements using biodegradable materials, they also improve biocompatibility for materials used for implantation. Several properties including biocompatibility are important when considering different biodegradable biomaterials. Biodegradable biomaterials can be synthetic or natural depending on their source and type of extracellular matrix (ECM).\\n\\n\\nBiocompatible plastics\\nSome of the most commonly-used biocompatible materials (or biomaterials) are polymers due to their inherent flexibility and tunable mechanical properties. Medical devices made of plastics are often made of a select few including: cyclic olefin polymer (COP), cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), polycarbonate (PC), polyetherimide (PEI), medical grade polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethersulfone (PES), polyethylene (PE), polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and even polypropylene (PP). To ensure biocompatibility, there are a series of regulated tests that material must pass to be certified for use. These include the United States Pharmacopoeia IV (USP Class IV) Biological Reactivity Test and the International Standards Organization 10993 (ISO 10993) Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices. The main objective of biocompatibility tests is to quantify the acute and chronic toxicity of material and determine any potential adverse effects during use conditions, thus the tests required for a given material are dependent on its end-use (i.e. blood, central nervous system, etc.).\\n\\n\\nSurface and bulk properties\\nTwo properties that have a large effect on the functionality of a biomaterial is the surface and bulk properties.\\nBulk properties refers to the physical and chemical properties that compose the biomaterial for its entire lifetime. They can be specifically generated to mimic the physiochemical properties of the tissue that the material is replacing. They are mechanical properties that are generated from a material\\'s atomic and molecular construction.\\nImportant bulk properties:\\n\\nChemical Composition\\nMicrostructure\\nElasticity\\nTensile Strength\\nDensity\\nHardness\\nElectrical Conductivity\\nThermal Conductivity\\nSurface properties refers to the chemical and topographical features on the surface of the biomaterial that will have direct interaction with the host blood/tissue. Surface engineering and modification allows clinicians to better control the interactions of a biomaterial with the host living system.\\nImportant surface properties:\\n\\nWettability (surface energy)\\nSurface chemistry\\nSurface textures (smooth/rough)\\nTopographical factors including: size, shape, alignment, structure determine the roughness of a material.\\nSurface Tension\\nSurface Charge\\n\\n\\nMechanical properties\\nIn addition to a material being certified as biocompatible, biomaterials must be engineered specifically to their target application within a medical device. This is especially important in terms of mechanical properties which govern the way that a given biomaterial behaves. One of the most relevant material parameters is the Young\\'s Modulus, E, which describes a material\\'s elastic response to stresses. The Young\\'s Moduli of the tissue and the device that is being coupled to it must closely match for optimal compatibility between device and body, whether the device is implanted or mounted externally. Matching the elastic modulus makes it possible to limit movement and delamination at the biointerface between implant and tissue as well as avoiding stress concentration that can lead to mechanical failure. Other important properties are the tensile and compressive strengths which quantify the maximum stresses a material can withstand before breaking and may be used to set stress limits that a device may be subject to within or external to the body. Depending on the application, it may be desirable for a biomaterial to have high strength so that it is resistant to failure when subjected to a load, however in other applications it may be beneficial for the material to be low strength. There is a careful balance between strength and stiffness that determines how robust to failure the biomaterial device is. Typically, as the elasticity of the biomaterial increases, the ultimate tensile strength will decrease and vice versa. One application where a high-strength material is undesired is in neural probes; if a high-strength material is used in these applications the tissue will always fail before the device does (under applied load) because the Young\\'s Modulus of the dura mater and cerebral tissue is on the order of 500 Pa. When this happens, irreversible damage to the brain can occur, thus the biomaterial must have an elastic modulus less than or equal to brain tissue and a low tensile strength if an applied load is expected.\\nFor implanted biomaterials that may experience temperature fluctuations, e.g., dental implants, ductility is important. The material must be ductile for a similar reason that the tensile strength cannot be too high, ductility allows the material to bend without fracture and also prevents the concentration of stresses in the tissue when the temperature changes. The material property of toughness is also important for dental implants as well as any other rigid, load-bearing implant such as a replacement hip joint. Toughness describes the material\\'s ability to deform under applied stress without fracturing and having a high toughness allows biomaterial implants to last longer within the body, especially when subjected to large stress or cyclically loaded stresses, like the stresses applied to a hip joint during running.\\nFor medical devices that are implanted or attached to the skin, another important property requiring consideration is the flexural rigidity, D. Flexural rigidity will determine how well the device surface can maintain conformal contact with the tissue surface, which is especially important for devices that are measuring tissue motion (strain), electrical signals (impedance), or are designed to stick to the skin without delaminating, as in epidermal electronics. Since flexural rigidity depends on the thickness of the material, h, to the third power (h3), it is very important that a biomaterial can be formed into thin layers in the previously mentioned applications where conformality is paramount.\\n\\n\\nStructure\\nThe molecular composition of a biomaterial determines the physical and chemical properties of a biomaterial. These compositions create complex structures that allow the biomaterial to function, and therefore are necessary to define and understand in order to develop a biomaterial. biomaterials can be designed to replicate natural organisms, a process known as biomimetics. The structure of a biomaterial can be observed at different at different levels to better understand a materials properties and function.\\n\\n\\nAtomic structure\\n\\nThe arrangement of atoms and ions within a material is one of the most important structural properties of a biomaterial. The atomic structure of a material can be viewed at different levels, the sub atomic level, atomic or molecular level, as well as the ultra-structure created by the atoms and molecules. Intermolecular forces between the atoms and molecules that compose the material will determine its material and chemical properties.\\nThe sub atomic level observes the electrical structure of an individual atom to define its interactions with other atoms and molecules. The molecular structure observes the arrangement of atoms within the material. Finally the ultra-structure observes the 3-D structure created from the atomic and molecular structures of the material. The solid-state of a material is characterized by the intramolecular bonds between the atoms and molecules that comprise the material. Types of intramolecular bonds include: ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds. These bonds will dictate the physical and chemical properties of the material, as well as determine the type of material (ceramic, metal, or polymer).\\n\\n\\nMicrostructure\\n\\nThe microstructure of a material refers to the structure of an object, organism, or material as viewed at magnifications exceeding 25 times. It is composed of the different phases of form, size, and distribution of grains, pores, precipitates, etc. The majority of solid microstructures are crystalline, however some materials such as certain polymers will not crystallize when in the solid state.\\n\\n\\nCrystalline structure\\nCrystalline structure is the composition of ions, atoms, and molecules that are held together and ordered in a 3D shape. The main difference between a crystalline structure and an amorphous structure is the order of the components. Crystalline has the highest level of order possible in the material where amorphous structure consists of irregularities in the ordering pattern. One way to describe crystalline structures is through the crystal lattice, which is a three-dimensional representation of the location of a repeating factor (unit cell) in the structure denoted with lattices. There are 14 different configurations of atom arrangement in a crystalline structure, and are all represented under Bravais lattices.\\n\\n\\nDefects of crystalline structure\\n\\nDuring the formation of a crystalline structure, different impurities, irregularities, and other defects can form. These imperfections can form through deformation of the solid, rapid cooling, or high energy radiation. Types of defects include point defects, line defects, as well as edge dislocation.\\n\\n\\nMacrostructure\\nMacrostructure refers to the overall geometric properties that will influence the force at failure, stiffness, bending, stress distribution, and the weight of the material. It requires little to no magnification to reveal the macrostructure of a material. Observing the macrostructure reveals properties such as cavities, porosity, gas bubbles, stratification, and fissures. The material\\'s strength and elastic modulus are both independent of the macrostructure.\\n\\n\\nNatural biomaterials\\nBiomaterials can be constructed using only materials sourced from plants and animals in order to alter, replace, or repair human tissue/organs. Use of natural biomaterials were used as early as ancient Egypt, where indigenous people used animal skin as sutures. A more modern example is a hip replacement using ivory material which was first recorded in Germany 1891.\\nValuable criteria for viable natural biomaterials:\\n\\nBiodegradable\\nBiocompatible\\nAble to promote cell attachment and growth\\nNon-toxic\\nExamples of natural biomaterials:\\n\\nAlginate\\nMatrigel\\nFibrin\\nCollagen\\nMyocardial tissue engineering\\n\\n\\nBiopolymers\\n\\nBiopolymers are polymers produced by living organisms. Cellulose and starch, proteins and peptides, and DNA and RNA are all examples of biopolymers, in which the monomeric units, respectively, are sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides. Cellulose is both the most common biopolymer and the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33% of all plant matter is cellulose. On a similar manner, silk (proteinaceous biopolymer) has garnered tremendous research interest in a myriad of domains including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, microfluidics, drug delivery.\\n\\n\\nSee also\\nBionics\\nHydrogel\\nPolymeric surface\\nSurface modification of biomaterials with proteins\\nSynthetic biodegradable polymer\\nList of biomaterials\\n\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nJournal of Biomaterials Applications\\nCREB – Biomedical Engineering Research Centre Archived 2021-05-07 at the Wayback Machine\\nDepartment of Biomaterials at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam-Golm, Germany\\nOpen Innovation Campus for Biomaterials', 'categories': ['Category:All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements', 'Category:Articles with short description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from March 2023', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from May 2024', 'Category:Biomaterials', 'Category:Biomolecules', 'Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher', 'Category:CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list']}\n",

      "{'title': 'Materials science', 'content': 'Materials science is an interdisciplinary field of researching and discovering materials. Materials engineering is an engineering field of finding uses for materials in other fields and industries.\\nThe intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Age of Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools for its study.\\nMaterials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (processing) influences its structure, and thus the material\\'s properties and performance. The understanding of processing -structure-properties relationships is called the materials paradigm. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including nanotechnology, biomaterials, and metallurgy.\\nMaterials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis –  investigating materials, products, structures or components, which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various aviation accidents and incidents.\\n\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phases such as Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Steel Age are historic, if arbitrary examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of ceramics and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from metallurgy, which itself evolved from the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs demonstrated that the thermodynamic properties related to atomic structure in various phases are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science were products of the Space Race; the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as rubbers, plastics, semiconductors, and biomaterials.\\nBefore the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many eventual materials science departments were metallurgy or ceramics engineering departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th-century emphasis on metals and ceramics. The growth of material science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s, \"to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences.\" In comparison with mechanical engineering, the nascent material science field focused on addressing materials from the macro-level and on the approach that materials are designed on the basis of knowledge of behavior at the microscopic level. Due to the expanded knowledge of the link between atomic and molecular processes as well as the overall properties of materials, the design of materials came to be based on specific desired properties. The materials science field has since broadened to include every class of materials, including ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, magnetic materials, biomaterials, and nanomaterials, generally classified into three distinct groups: ceramics, metals, and polymers. The prominent change in materials science during the recent decades is active usage of computer simulations to find new materials, predict properties and understand phenomena.\\n\\n\\nFundamentals\\n\\nA material is defined as a substance (most often a solid, but other condensed phases can be included) that is intended to be used for certain applications.  There are a myriad of materials around us; they can be found in anything from new and advanced materials that are being developed include nanomaterials, biomaterials, and energy materials to name a few.\\nThe basis of materials science is studying the interplay between the structure of materials, the processing methods to make that material, and the resulting material properties. The complex combination of these produce the performance of a material in a specific application. Many features across many length scales impact material performance, from the constituent chemical elements, its microstructure, and macroscopic features from processing. Together with the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics materials scientists aim to understand and improve materials.\\n\\n\\nStructure\\nStructure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science. The very definition of the field holds that it is concerned with the investigation of \"the relationships that exist between the structures and properties of materials\". Materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale. Characterization is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material. This involves methods such as diffraction with X-rays, electrons or neutrons, and various forms of spectroscopy and chemical analysis such as Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, chromatography, thermal analysis, electron microscope analysis, etc.\\nStructure is studied in the following levels.\\n\\n\\nAtomic structure\\nAtomic structure deals with the atoms of the materials, and how they are arranged to give rise to molecules, crystals, etc. Much of the electrical, magnetic and chemical properties of materials arise from this level of structure. The length scales involved are in angstroms (Å). The chemical bonding and atomic arrangement (crystallography) are fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of any material.\\n\\n\\nBonding\\n\\nTo obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to its properties, the materials scientist must study how the different atoms, ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other. This involves the study and use of quantum chemistry or quantum physics. Solid-state physics, solid-state chemistry and physical chemistry are also involved in the study of bonding and structure.\\n\\n\\nCrystallography\\n\\nCrystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. Crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists. One of the fundamental concepts regarding the crystal structure of a material includes the unit cell, which is the smallest unit of a crystal lattice (space lattice) that repeats to make up the macroscopic crystal structure. Most common structural materials include parallelpiped and hexagonal lattice types. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Examples of crystal defects consist of dislocations including edges, screws, vacancies, self inter-stitials, and more that are linear, planar, and three dimensional types of defects. New and advanced materials that are being developed include nanomaterials, biomaterials. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in polycrystalline form, as an aggregate of small crystals or grains with different orientations. Because of this, the powder diffraction method, which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination. Most materials have a crystalline structure, but some important materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure. Polymers display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely non-crystalline. Glass, some ceramics, and many natural materials are amorphous, not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and mechanical descriptions of physical properties.\\n\\n\\nNanostructure\\n\\nMaterials, which atoms and molecules form constituents in the nanoscale (i.e., they form nanostructures) are called nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are the subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit.\\nNanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1 – 100 nm range.  In many materials, atoms or molecules agglomerate to form objects at the nanoscale. This causes many interesting electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties.\\nIn describing nanostructures, it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale.\\nNanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100 nm.\\nNanotubes have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100 nm; its length could be much greater.\\nFinally, spherical nanoparticles have three dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100 nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and ultrafine particles (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term \\'nanostructure\\' is often used, when referring to magnetic technology. Nanoscale structure in biology is often called ultrastructure.\\n\\n\\nMicrostructure\\n\\nMicrostructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil of material as revealed by a microscope above 25× magnification. It deals with objects from 100 nm to a few cm. The microstructure of a material (which can be broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on. Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are microstructured.\\nThe manufacture of a perfect crystal of a material is physically impossible. For example, any crystalline material will contain defects such as precipitates, grain boundaries (Hall–Petch relationship), vacancies, interstitial atoms or substitutional atoms. The microstructure of materials reveals these larger defects and advances in simulation have allowed an increased understanding of how defects can be used to enhance material properties.\\n\\n\\nMacrostructure\\nMacrostructure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to meters, it is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye.\\n\\n\\nProperties\\n\\nMaterials exhibit myriad properties, including the following.\\n\\nMechanical properties, see Strength of materials\\nChemical properties, see Chemistry\\nElectrical properties, see Electricity\\nThermal properties, see Thermodynamics\\nOptical properties, see Optics and Photonics\\nMagnetic properties, see Magnetism\\nThe properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering application.\\n\\n\\nProcessing\\nSynthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micro-nanostructure. A material cannot be used in industry if no economically viable production method for it has been developed. Therefore, developing processing methods for materials that are reasonably effective and cost-efficient is vital to the field of materials science. Different materials require different processing or synthesis methods. For example, the processing of metals has historically defined eras such as the Bronze Age and Iron Age and is studied under the branch of materials science named physical metallurgy. Chemical and physical methods are also used to synthesize other materials such as polymers, ceramics, semiconductors, and thin films. As of the early 21st century, new methods are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as graphene.\\n\\n\\nThermodynamics\\n\\nThermodynamics is concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. It defines macroscopic variables, such as internal energy, entropy, and pressure, that partly describe a body of matter or radiation. It states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints common to all materials. These general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body, not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, statistical mechanics.\\nThe study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It explains fundamental tools such as phase diagrams and concepts such as phase equilibrium.\\n\\n\\nKinetics\\n\\nChemical kinetics is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces. When applied to materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time (moves from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state) due to application of a certain field. It details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape, size, composition and structure. Diffusion is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change. Kinetics is essential in processing of materials because, among other things, it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat.\\n\\n\\nResearch\\nMaterials science is a highly active area of research. Together with materials science departments, physics, chemistry, and many engineering departments are involved in materials research. Materials research covers a broad range of topics; the following non-exhaustive list highlights a few important research areas.\\n\\n\\nNanomaterials\\n\\nNanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometers (10−9 meter), but is usually 1 nm – 100 nm. Nanomaterials research takes a materials science based approach to nanotechnology, using advances in materials metrology and synthesis, which have been developed in support of microfabrication research. Materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, or mechanical properties. The field of nanomaterials is loosely organized, like the traditional field of chemistry, into organic (carbon-based) nanomaterials, such as fullerenes, and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements, such as silicon. Examples of nanomaterials include fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nanocrystals, etc.\\n\\n\\nBiomaterials\\n\\nA biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering, and materials science.\\nBiomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in a laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches using metallic components, polymers, bioceramics, or composite materials. They are often intended or adapted for medical applications, such as biomedical devices which perform, augment, or replace a natural function. Such functions may be benign, like being used for a heart valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxylapatite-coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as an organ transplant material.\\n\\n\\nElectronic, optical, and magnetic\\n\\nSemiconductors, metals, and ceramics are used today to form highly complex systems, such as integrated electronic circuits, optoelectronic devices, and magnetic and optical mass storage media. These materials form the basis of our modern computing world, and hence research into these materials is of vital importance.\\nSemiconductors are a traditional example of these types of materials. They are materials that have properties that are intermediate between conductors and insulators. Their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to the concentration of impurities, which allows the use of doping to achieve desirable electronic properties. Hence, semiconductors form the basis of the traditional computer.\\nThis field also includes new areas of research such as superconducting materials, spintronics, metamaterials, etc. The study of these materials involves knowledge of materials science and solid-state physics or condensed matter physics.\\n\\n\\nComputational materials science\\n\\nWith continuing increases in computing power, simulating the behavior of materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to understand behavior and mechanisms, design new materials, and explain properties formerly poorly understood. Efforts surrounding integrated computational materials engineering are now focusing on combining computational methods with experiments to drastically reduce the time and effort to optimize materials properties for a given application. This involves simulating materials at all length scales, using methods such as density functional theory, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, dislocation dynamics, phase field, finite element, and many more.\\n\\n\\nIndustry\\n\\nRadical materials advances can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods (casting, rolling, welding, ion implantation, crystal growth, thin-film deposition, sintering, glassblowing, etc.), and analytic methods (characterization methods such as electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, calorimetry, nuclear microscopy (HEFIB), Rutherford backscattering, neutron diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).\\nBesides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer. Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced.\\nSolid materials are generally grouped into three basic classifications: ceramics, metals, and polymers. This broad classification is based on the empirical makeup and atomic structure of the solid materials, and most solids fall into one of these broad categories. An item that is often made from each of these materials types is the beverage container. The material types used for beverage containers accordingly provide different advantages and disadvantages, depending on the material used. Ceramic (glass) containers are optically transparent, impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide, relatively inexpensive, and are easily recycled, but are also heavy and fracture easily. Metal (aluminum alloy) is relatively strong, is a good barrier to the diffusion of carbon dioxide, and is easily recycled. However, the cans are opaque, expensive to produce, and are easily dented and punctured. Polymers (polyethylene plastic) are relatively strong, can be optically transparent, are inexpensive and lightweight, and can be recyclable, but are not as impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide as aluminum and glass.\\n\\n\\nCeramics and glasses\\n\\nAnother application of materials science is the study of ceramics and glasses, typically the most brittle materials with industrial relevance. Many ceramics and glasses exhibit covalent or ionic-covalent bonding with SiO2 (silica) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics – not to be confused with raw, unfired clay – are usually seen in crystalline form. The vast majority of commercial glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At the high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid which solidifies into a disordered state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also used for long-range telecommunication and optical transmission. Scratch resistant Corning Gorilla Glass is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components.\\nEngineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, silicon carbide, and tungsten carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.\\nCeramics can be significantly strengthened for engineering applications using the principle of crack deflection. This process involves the strategic addition of second-phase particles within a ceramic matrix, optimizing their shape, size, and distribution to direct and control crack propagation. This approach enhances fracture toughness, paving the way for the creation of advanced, high-performance ceramics in various industries.\\n\\n\\nComposites\\n\\nAnother application of materials science in industry is making composite materials. These are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases.\\nApplications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles, which play a key and integral role in NASA\\'s Space Shuttle thermal protection system, which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth\\'s atmosphere. One example is reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC), the light gray material, which withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1,510 °C (2,750 °F) and protects the Space Shuttle\\'s wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfuryl alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the furfuryl alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reusability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide.\\nOther examples can be seen in the \"plastic\" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a composite material made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) in which calcium carbonate chalk, talc, glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.\\n\\n\\nPolymers\\n\\nPolymers are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical components linked together like chains. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics in former and in current widespread use include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates. Rubbers include natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, chloroprene, and butadiene rubber. Plastics are generally classified as commodity, specialty and engineering plastics.\\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to a vast array of applications, from artificial leather to electrical insulation and cabling, packaging, and containers. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of plasticisers and other additives that it accepts. The term \"additives\" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties.\\nPolycarbonate would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK, ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.\\nSpecialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc.\\nThe dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, polyethylene (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted hip joints.\\n\\n\\nMetal alloys\\n\\nThe alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the largest proportion of metals today both by quantity and commercial value.\\nIron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00% by weight. For steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. In contrast, certain metal alloys exhibit unique properties where their size and density remain unchanged across a range of temperatures. Cast iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00%, but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of chromium. Nickel and molybdenum are typically also added in stainless steels.\\nOther significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and magnesium. Copper alloys have been known for a long time (since the Bronze Age), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength to weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength to weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.\\n\\n\\nSemiconductors\\n\\nA semiconductor is a material that has a resistivity between a conductor and insulator. Modern day electronics run on semiconductors, and the industry had an estimated US$530 billion market in 2021. Its electronic properties can be greatly altered through intentionally introducing impurities in a process referred to as doping. Semiconductor materials are used to build diodes, transistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and analog and digital electric circuits, among their many uses. Semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices like vacuum tubes in most applications. Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as integrated circuits (ICs), which consist of a number—from a few to millions—of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.\\nOf all the semiconductors in use today, silicon makes up the largest portion both by quantity and commercial value. Monocrystalline silicon is used to produce wafers used in the semiconductor and electronics industry. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is the second most popular semiconductor used. Due to its higher electron mobility and saturation velocity compared to silicon, it is a material of choice for high-speed electronics applications. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency radar systems. Other semiconductor materials include germanium, silicon carbide, and gallium nitride and have various applications.\\n\\n\\nRelation with other fields\\n\\nMaterials science evolved, starting from the 1950s because it was recognized that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged in many ways: renaming and/or combining existing metallurgy and ceramics engineering departments; splitting from existing solid state physics research (itself growing into condensed matter physics); pulling in relatively new polymer engineering and polymer science; recombining from the previous, as well as chemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering; and more.\\nThe field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as for applications field. Materials are of the utmost importance for engineers (or other applied fields) because usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer\\'s education.\\nMaterials physics is the use of physics to describe the physical properties of materials. It is a synthesis of physical sciences such as chemistry, solid mechanics, solid state physics, and materials science. Materials physics is considered a subset of condensed matter physics and applies fundamental condensed matter concepts to complex multiphase media, including materials of technological interest. Current fields that materials physicists work in include electronic, optical, and magnetic materials, novel materials and structures, quantum phenomena in materials, nonequilibrium physics, and soft condensed matter physics. New experimental and computational tools are constantly improving how materials systems are modeled and studied and are also fields when materials physicists work in.\\nThe field is inherently interdisciplinary, and the materials scientists or engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist and engineer. Conversely, fields such as life sciences and archaeology can inspire the development of new materials and processes, in bioinspired and paleoinspired approaches. Thus, there remain close relationships with these fields. Conversely, many physicists, chemists and engineers find themselves working in materials science due to the significant overlaps between the fields.\\n\\n\\nEmerging technologies\\n\\n\\nSubdisciplines\\nThe main branches of materials science stem from the four main classes of materials: ceramics, metals, polymers and composites.\\n\\nCeramic engineering\\nMetallurgy\\nPolymer science and engineering\\nComposite engineering\\nThere are additionally broadly applicable, materials independent, endeavors.\\n\\nMaterials characterization (spectroscopy, microscopy, diffraction)\\nComputational materials science\\nMaterials informatics and selection\\nThere are also relatively broad focuses across materials on specific phenomena and techniques.\\n\\nCrystallography\\nSurface science\\nTribology\\nMicroelectronics\\n\\n\\nRelated or interdisciplinary fields\\nCondensed matter physics, solid-state physics and solid-state chemistry\\nNanotechnology\\nMineralogy\\nSupramolecular chemistry\\nBiomaterials science\\n\\n\\nProfessional societies\\nAmerican Ceramic Society\\nASM International\\nAssociation for Iron and Steel Technology\\nMaterials Research Society\\nThe Minerals, Metals & Materials Society\\n\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\nCitations\\n\\n\\nBibliography\\nAshby, Michael; Hugh Shercliff; David Cebon (2007).
